## üßÆ Algorithms & Calculations

### EMI Formula
```
EMI = [P √ó R √ó (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N - 1]
```
Where:
- P = Principal loan amount
- R = Monthly interest rate (Annual rate / 12 / 100)
- N = Tenure in months

### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
Loan ranking based on weighted scoring:
- **Total Interest**: 35%
- **Monthly EMI**: 25%
- **Total Cost**: 20%
- **Tenure**: 10%
- **Processing Fees**: 10%

Each metric is normalized (0-100 scale) and weighted to produce a composite score.

### Prepayment Impact
Calculates remaining principal after N months, applies prepayment, then:
- **Reduce EMI**: Keeps tenure same, recalculates lower EMI
- **Reduce Tenure**: Keeps EMI same, calculates months saved
